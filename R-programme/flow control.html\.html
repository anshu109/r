# Control Statements in R Programming

Control statements are expressions used to control the execution and flow of the program based on the conditions provided in the statements. These structures are used to make a decision after assessing the variable. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss all the control statements with the examples.

In R programming, there are 8 types of control statements as follows:
  
if condition

if-else condition

for loop

nested loops

while loop

repeat and break statement

return statement

next statement

## if condition

This control structure checks the expression provided in parenthesis is true or not. If true, the execution of the statements in braces {} continues. 

Syntax:
  
  if(expression){
  
    statements
    
    ....
    
    ....
    
  }
  
Example:
```{r}
  x <- 100

if(x > 10){
  print(paste(x, "is greater than 10"))
}
```
## Excercise : 

Create program where the user can enter a number , and if the number is even print 'This number is even!' or else print 'This number is odd' and otherwise 'This is not a valid number'

## if-else condition

It is similar to if condition but when the test expression in if condition fails, then statements in else condition are executed.

Syntax:
  
  if(expression){
  
    statements
    
    ....
    
    ....
    
  }
  
else{

  statements
  
  ....
  
  ....
  
}

Example:

```{r}
x <- 5

# Check value is less than or greater than 10
if(x > 10){
  print(paste(x, "is greater than 10"))
}else{
  print(paste(x, "is less than 10"))
}
```

## for loop

It is a type of loop or sequence of statements executed repeatedly until exit condition is reached.

Syntax:
  
  for(value in vector){
  
    statements
    
    ....
    
    ....
    
  }
  
Example:
```{r}
  
  x <- letters[4:10]

for(i in x){
  print(i)
}
```
## Excercise : 

Print the following pattern

1 12 123 1234 12345


## Nested loops

Nested loops are similar to simple loops. Nested means loops inside loop. Moreover, nested loops are used to manipulate the matrix.

Example:
  
```{r}
 # Defining matrix
  m <- matrix(2:15, 2)

for (r in seq(nrow(m))) {
  for (c in seq(ncol(m))) {
    print(m[r, c])
  }
}
```
 
## while loop

while loop is another kind of loop iterated until a condition is satisfied. The testing expression is checked first before executing the body of loop.

Syntax:
  
  while(expression){
  
    statement
    
    ....
    
    ....
    
  }
  
Example:
```{r}
  x = 1

# Print 1 to 5
while(x <= 5){
  print(x)
  x = x + 1
}
```
  
## Excercise :

Display the numbers from 4 to 100 using the while loop
